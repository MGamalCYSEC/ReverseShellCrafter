  ### Note
  PHP files can have various extensions depending on their purpose or compatibility, such as `.php` (the standard for modern scripts), `.php3` (for PHP 3.x), `.php4` (for PHP 4.x), `.php5` (for PHP 5.x), `.php7` (for PHP 7.x), and `.php8` (for PHP 8.x). Other common extensions include `.phtml` (for PHP mixed with HTML), `.phps` (for syntax-highlighted source files), `.inc` (typically for include files, often paired with `.php`), `.class.php` (for class definitions), `.lib.php` (for library files), and `.tpl` (used in templating systems like Smarty). While legacy extensions like `.php3`, `.php4`, and `.php5` are rare today, `.php` remains the universal standard, and server configurations should prevent direct access to sensitive files like `.inc`. So try to change the format
