The folder contains reverse shell scripts for PHP, ASP, and ASPX, which establish a reverse connection using `nc.exe` (Netcat) to a designated `local IP` and `port`, executing `cmd.exe` from the current directory. 

Ensure that you replace `<LOCAL-IP>` and `<PORT>` with the IP address and port number of your listener.

It is crucial that `nc.exe` is uploaded to the target machine in the same directory prior to execution for proper functionality.
