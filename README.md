## üõ† **Setup and Usage**  

### **Step 1**: Start a Listener  
Start a Netcat listener on your local machine to catch the reverse shell connection. Replace `<PORT>` with the desired port number:  
```bash
rlwrap nc -nlvp <PORT>
```

### **Step 2**: Customize the Script  
Edit the script to replace `<LOCAL-IP>` with your IP address and `<PORT>` with the port used in the listener.

### **Step 3**: Upload and Execute  
1. Upload the script to the target machine or web server.  
2. Execute the script using the appropriate method (e.g., accessing it via a browser for web shells, running it directly on the target machine, etc.).  

### **Example**  
For a PHP reverse shell:  
1. Upload `reverse.php` to the server.  
2. Visit `http://<target>/reverse.php` in your browser.  
3. Receive the shell on your Netcat listener.
