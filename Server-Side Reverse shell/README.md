### **Important Notes**
- **Netcat Requirement**:
  Ensure `nc.exe` is present in the current directory or a directory in the PATH on the target machine. If not, upload it first.
- Start a **Netcat listener** on your machine:
   ```bash
   nc -nlvp <PORT>
   # recommended
   rlwrap nc -nlvp <PORT>
   ```
